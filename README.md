<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This app lets people that regularly go to the gym track their exercise results in every session, allowing them to review their pervious results, so that with each new session, they can use the results of the previous session as the goal to beat (or match) for the current session. Over time the person going to the gym will be able to see how they have improved.

## App Usage Walkthrough

To start off, enter in your email address - all recorded information will be associated with your email address, so you can log in from any device and pickup where you left off.

Then on the 'Select your training session for today' select the type of gym weight lifting training session you would like to complete today. Choices are 'Chest', 'Back', 'Arms' and 'Legs'.

Once you've selected a training session, go ahead and click the 'Add Exercise' button to add the exercise you're about to do at the gym. For example, if you're doing a 'Chest' session at the gym, you might start off with 'Bench Press' as your first exercise. Go ahead and add 'Bench Press'.

Once you've added your exercise, do you first set at your required weight. When you're done doing your set, click on 'Add Set' in the app to record the weight and reps for that set. If you made a typo, you can click the edit button to the right of the recorded set. Or if you simply don't want to keep that set, just click the delete button to the left of the recorded set.

When you're ready to move on to the next exercise, just add a new exercise and start recording the sets for it.

When you come back to the gym the following week to do the same training session, the Gym Tracker App will automatically find the exercises you did last week and pre-populate them for you, so you don't have to type them in again. All you need to do is just add a set as per normal to the appropriate exercise. Addiionally, the Gym Tracker App will tell you what your best set was during the last session for each of the given exercises, so you know what to set your goal as for this session.
